## Idea B – DINS (Dependency Is Not Stable)
This paper prototype investigates a tower-building game that metaphorically represents software dependency management, and emphasises structure and balance.
The prototype focuses on physical instability and gradual decay.

### Prototype Focus
Stacking dependency blocks over time while managing their stability and decay. Time progression and ageing are simulated manually to observe how players react to increasing pressure.

### Player Actions
- Place a dependency block onto the tower
- Remove or replace unstable blocks
- Advance time manually with the help of the facilitator
- Observe collapse conditions

### Challenges Identified Through Prototyping
1. Players need very clear rules to understand why and when blocks decay.
2. Without visual cues, it is hard to communicate dependency importance.
