## Idea A – Cat vs Dog (Paper Prototype)
This paper prototype explores a fast-paced, turn-based action game inspired by casual browser games.
For the purpose of the prototype, the original animal characters are re-themed as the five Term 1 lecturers, while the core mechanics remain simple and physical.

### Prototype Focus
Players take turns throwing weapons at each other until one side is defeated.

### Player Actions
- Choose a character (each with slightly different strengths)
- Select a weapon (e.g. axe, bomb; placeholder cards used)
- Perform a turn-based attack
- Resolve the outcome immediately (hit, miss, damage)

### Challenges
1. Balancing character abilities is difficult, needing clear visual feedback.
2. The variety of Weapon increases cognitive load for new players.
