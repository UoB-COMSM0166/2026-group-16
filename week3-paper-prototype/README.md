## Idea A – Cat vs Dog (TBA)
This paper prototype explores a fast-paced, turn-based action game inspired by casual browser games.
For the purpose of the prototype, the original animal characters are re-themed as the five Term 1 lecturers, while the core mechanics remain simple and physical.

### Prototype Focus
Players take turns throwing weapons at each other until one side is defeated.

### Player Actions
- Choose a character (each with slightly different strengths)
- Select a weapon (e.g. axe, bomb; placeholder cards used)
- Perform a turn-based attack
- Resolve the outcome immediately (hit, miss, damage)

### Challenges
1. Balancing character abilities is difficult, needing clear visual feedback.
2. The variety of Weapon increases cognitive load for new players.


## Idea B – DINS (Dependency Is Not Stable)
This paper prototype investigates a tower-building game that metaphorically represents software dependency management, and emphasises structure and balance.
The prototype focuses on physical instability and gradual decay.

### Prototype Focus
Stacking dependency blocks over time while managing their stability and decay. Time progression and ageing are simulated manually to observe how players react to increasing pressure.

### Player Actions
- Place a dependency block onto the tower
- Remove or replace unstable blocks
- Advance time manually with the help of the facilitator
- Observe collapse conditions

### Challenges Identified Through Prototyping
1. Players need very clear rules to understand why and when blocks decay.
2. Without visual cues, it is hard to communicate dependency importance.
