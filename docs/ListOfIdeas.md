# **Game Ideas**

We have gathered a variety of game concepts, mechanics, and design experiments for our project.    
🎯 Rough drafts welcome.

# 1. Slice It All

### Description
> Slice It All is a casual 3D action game where players control a flipping knife that moves forward through a series of obstacles.
> The game relies on basic physics simulation, including gravity, momentum, and rotational motion, combined with collision detection to determine successful slices or failures.
> Precise timing and interaction with objects drive the gameplay, as accurate collisions allow the knife to cut through materials while missed or incorrect impacts cause the run to end.

# 2. Arrow Combo
 
### Description
> Arrow Combo is a casual arcade game where players aim and shoot arrows at moving targets to build score-boosting combos.
> The game uses projectile physics to simulate arrow trajectory and speed, along with collision detection to determine accurate hits and misses.
> Timing, precision, and a combo-based scoring system drive progression, rewarding consistent accuracy while penalizing failed shots.

# 3. Fleabag vs Mutt

### Description
> Fleabag vs Mutt (Cat vs Dog) is a casual one- or two-player browser game where a cat and a dog engage in a fast-paced item-throwing duel.
> The game uses simple physics and collision detection to handle projectile motion, hit registration, cooldowns, and character stats such as health, strength, and recharge power.
> Dynamic characters, varied weapons, and changing environments create chaotic, reflex-driven gameplay that works equally well against AI or another player.

# 4. Shoot the Duck

### Description
> Shoot The Duck is a casual browser hunting game where players aim and fire at flying duck targets to score as many hits as possible before the round ends.
> The game uses projectile and timing mechanics, with simple collision detection to register successful shots and misses as ducks fly across the screen.
> Players must balance quick reflexes and accuracy to hit the targets while they’re in motion, often guided by on-screen indicators showing how many ducks remain.

# 5. Impostor Archer War

### Description
> Impostor Archer War is an action-arcade archery game where players control a character to aim and shoot arrows at enemy impostors while dodging incoming fire.
> The game uses projectile physics for arrow movement and collision detection to register hits and misses, with precision and timing determining success.
> Players can collect upgrades and coins to improve arrows and abilities as they progress through increasingly challenging encounters.

# 6. Tower-Building

### Description
> DINS (Dependency Is Not Stable) is a physics-based tower-building game where players stack and manage software dependencies represented as unstable blocks.
> The game uses gravity, structural physics, and collision detection to simulate balance, stress, aging, and eventual collapse over time.
> Players must strategically choose between rapid expansion and ongoing maintenance, as neglected dependencies decay and trigger cascading failures.

# 7. The Illusionist's Dreams

### Description
> In Illusionist’s Dreams, player navigates in the game environment under the "dream logic".
> Shapeshifting is the primary hook of the game. Player will start as a human but would have to transform into different creatures and utilize thier ability so as to reach the exit of each level.
> The art style of the game is typically atmospheric and minimalist, emphasizing the "dreamy" aspect of the background scene.
