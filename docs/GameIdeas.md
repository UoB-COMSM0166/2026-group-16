# **Game Ideas**

We have gathered a variety of game concepts, mechanics, and design experiments for our project.    
🎯 Rough drafts welcome.

# 1. Tower-Building

## 1.1 Statement

**DINS (Dependency Is Not Stable)** is a tower-building game that translates the fragility of modern software development into **visceral, physics-based gameplay**.  

Players construct and maintain a tower of software dependencies, balancing rapid growth against inevitable decay — until **catastrophic collapse**.

---

## 1.2 Inspiration

The game is inspired by [xkcd #2347, "Dependency"](https://xkcd.com/2347/) (Munroe, 2020). The comic highlights the instability of modern software practices by depicting a tower of digital infrastructure, precariously propped up by:

> "a project some random person in Nebraska has been thanklessly maintaining since 2003."

DINS also builds on the concept of the **software crisis** discussed in our module lectures, and reflects real-world events such as the **left-pad incident (2016)** — when the removal of an 11-line npm package broke thousands of projects, including major platforms like Facebook and Netflix.

---

## 1.3 The Twist

DINS blends the **spatial strategy of Tetris** with the **instability of Jenga**, while introducing **time as a core mechanic**:  

- Blocks **age**, **decay**, and demand ongoing attention.  
- Players must balance growth and maintenance under pressure.  

The game is also **meta-reflexive**: it demonstrates software engineering principles by simulating the consequences of software engineering failures.

---

## 1.4 Working Title

The working title, **"DINS"**, follows the tradition of recursive acronyms in computer science (e.g., **GNU's Not Unix**, **WINE Is Not an Emulator**), adding an extra layer of **irony and humor** to the game's story.

---

## 1.5 Alternative Titles

- **STACKS** — *Software Towers Always Collapse, Keep Stacking*  
- **YAG** — *Yet Another Game*  
- **FOSS** — *Falling Open Source Software*

# 2. Fleabag vs Mutt

---

## 2.1 Statement

*Cat* is a casual browser game that can be played by **one or two players**, where a mischievous cat interacts with a dog in a playful duel. Players throw items at each other, testing their **timing, reflexes, and strategy**, until one side dominates the round.  

The game emphasizes **fast, fun, and lighthearted competition**, making it ideal for both solo and multiplayer play.

---

## 2.2 Inspiration

The game draws inspiration from **classic mini-games and animal rivalries**, where simplicity and humor drive the gameplay.  

It transforms the playful conflict between a cat and a dog into an **interactive and entertaining experience** for casual players.

---

## 2.3 The Twist

The twist lies in the **dynamic and unpredictable gameplay**:  

- Before entering the game, players can choose among 3-5 characters, each is with different specialty and strength and performs better with specific weapons
    -> Suggested characteristics include:
       1. HP
       2. Strength
       3. Recharge power
       4. Healing power
- Items thrown by the character vary in size and speed, requiring players to react quickly.  
- Each round is **chaotic yet fun**, creating tense and humorous interactions.  
- Works equally well in **single-player mode** (against AI) or in **two-player mode** (against another human).
- Background scenario will be changed every 2 or 3 rounds of attack, some characters are advantaged at specific scenarios (similar to home turf)
    -> For example, attack strength doubled, attack ranged maximized, opponent's weapon weakened, recharge efficiency raised

---

## 2.4 Working Title

The game is simply titled **“Cat vs Dog”**, reflecting the **central character and minimalistic design**. The name highlights the casual, approachable nature of the game.

---

## 2.5 Alternative Titles

- **Bug vs Feature** — classic developer humor; every “feature” is secretly a bug.  
- **MEOW vs BARK** — simple, direct, and playful.  
- **PAW‑WER STRUGGLE** — pun on “power struggle” + paws.
- **GODS OF CODING** -- characters of legendary figures involved in each round of battle
- **CLASH OF CODES** -- game developed with heavy CS context and developer humor
