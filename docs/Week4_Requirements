Acceptance criteria: 
Given that motions of the characters and weapons within the game is abide by physical principles then it ensure object physics is just (e.g. no objects passes through solid surfaces during collision).
Input delay should not exist certain time limit (need further research for the valid time limit) and throw direction corresponds to player input accurately. (exact button to be used will be determined by A/B Testing)
Given that all functional and non-functional requirements are documented in a shared repository and contribution guidelines are published and accessible to all team members, it ensures the smooth development of the game (matching deadlines)
Given that consistent colour palette are used across all screens and no distorted graphics appear on supported screen sizes, it ensures the gaming graphics are appealing to players and they are willing to play the game for at least 5 min in the first play-through.
Given all critical and high-severity bugs are resolved before release, the game should be running without crashes for a defined play session (e.g. 15-30 min)
Given that clear instructions of the game is provided in the initial screens of the game, it ensures the game is without complex or hidden control combinations and new users can start without external help.
